  Run the code in blocks so you can see every step of the way
  
  Make sure that you uploaded your data into google collabe if you are going to use 
  Google collab, if you are using Other coding software
  Make sure that your data is in the correct Directory, and That is it in CSV format
  As this code Is designed for CSV
  
  First Step is to import the necessary Modules
